## 📁 Project Architecture

### Auto-Registration Pattern ⭐

**Key Innovation:** Blocks register themselves on import!

```typescript
// Just create a file: src/components/blocks/my-block.tsx
export function MyBlock(props) {
  return <div>...</div>;
}

// Add registration at the bottom
registerBlock({
  type: 'myBlock',
  name: 'My Block',
  component: MyBlock,
  defaultProps: { /* ... */ },
  icon: 'box',
  category: 'content',
});

// Import it: src/components/blocks/index.tsx
import './my-block';

// Done! It appears in the builder automatically ✨
```

### Database Schema

```typescript
Sites
├─ id, name, domain, logoUrl
├─ Theme (1:1)
│  └─ colors, fonts, spacing, borders
├─ Pages (1:many)
│  └─ slug, title, blocks (JSON), isPublished
└─ Media (1:many)
   └─ url, filename, metadata
```

### Block System

Pages are JSON arrays of blocks:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "abc123",
    "type": "hero",
    "props": {
      "title": "Welcome",
      "subtitle": "Excellence in Education",
      "alignment": "center"
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "def456",
    "type": "news",
    "props": {
      "title": "Latest News",
      "items": [...]
    }
  }
]
```

## 🎨 Available Blocks

| Block | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Hero** | Content | Large banner with CTA |
| **Gallery** | Media | Image grid with captions |
| **Staff** | People | Team directory with bios |
| **Content** | Content | Rich text sections |
| **Events** | Interactive | Calendar & event listings |
| **Contact** | Interactive | Contact form & info |
| **News** | Content | News feed with layouts |
