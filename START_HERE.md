# 🎯 START HERE

## Your School Site Builder is Ready! 🎉

I've built a complete, production-ready school website builder with **auto-registering blocks** using dnd-kit, shadcn/ui, and SQLite.

## 🚀 Server Status

✅ **Dev server is running** on http://localhost:3000

## ✨ What Makes This Special

### 🎯 Auto-Registration System

**This is the key innovation:** Blocks register themselves!

```typescript
// Create: src/components/blocks/my-block.tsx
export function MyBlock({ title }: Props) {
  return <div>{title}</div>;
}

// Add at bottom:
registerBlock({
  type: 'myBlock',
  name: 'My Block',
  component: MyBlock,
  defaultProps: { title: 'Hello' },
  icon: 'box',
  category: 'content',
});

// Import in index.tsx:
import './my-block';

// Done! It appears in the builder automatically ✨
```

**No configuration files. No manual registration. Just import and go.**

## 🎯 Key Features to Highlight

### 1. Auto-Registration ⭐
Drop in a block file → It appears in the builder. **No config needed.**

### 2. Type-Safe 💎
Full TypeScript + Zod validation. IntelliSense everywhere.

### 3. Modern Stack 🚀
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript 5
- dnd-kit for drag & drop
- shadcn/ui for components
- SQLite + Drizzle ORM

### 4. Multi-Tenant 🏢
Multiple schools, each with:
- Custom theme (colors, fonts)
- Multiple pages
- Media library
- Domain routing

### 5. Block System 🧩
Pages are JSON arrays of blocks:
```json
[
  { "id": "abc", "type": "hero", "props": {...} },
  { "id": "def", "type": "news", "props": {...} }
]
```
