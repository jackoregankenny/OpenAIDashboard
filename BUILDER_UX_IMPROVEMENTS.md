## Technical Implementation

### New Props to PageBuilder:
```tsx
interface PageBuilderProps {
  initialBlocks?: Block[];
  onSave?: (blocks: Block[]) => void;
  page?: Page;              // Current page info
  site?: Site;              // Current site info
  allPages?: Page[];        // All pages in site
  onPublish?: () => void;   // Publish handler
  onPageChange?: (id) => void; // Switch page handler
  onBackToAdmin?: () => void;  // Back to admin handler
}
```

### State Management:
```tsx
const [showThemePanel, setShowThemePanel] = useState(false);
const [showSettingsPanel, setShowSettingsPanel] = useState(false);
```

### Components Used:
- `Sheet` - Side panels from shadcn
- `DropdownMenu` - Page selector
- `Button` - All actions
- `ThemeCustomizer` - Integrated in panel
