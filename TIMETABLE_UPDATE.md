✅ Timetable Updates Complete!

🎯 Fixed Issues:
1. React key prop warning - Used flatMap() to properly flatten the grid structure
2. Added multi-class/year support for timetables

🆕 New Features:
1. **Class Selector**: Dropdown to switch between different year groups (Year 7-12)
2. **Multi-Schedule Support**: Store separate schedules for each class
3. **Backward Compatible**: Still works with single schedule for simple use cases

📝 How It Works:
- Turn on 'showClassSelector' to enable the year group dropdown
- Add schedules for each class in the 'schedules' object
- Users can switch between classes to see different timetables
- Perfect for schools with multiple year groups!

🎨 Drag & Drop Previews:
- All blocks show mini previews in the sidebar
- Drag any block directly to the canvas
- Webflow-style professional UX

🚀 Ready to use!
